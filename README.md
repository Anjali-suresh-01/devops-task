# Setting Up Your Web Application with Docker

This guide will walk you through the process of Dockerizing your web application and hosting it on GitHub.

## 1. Create a GitRepository:

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub
- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in.
- Click on the '+' icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository".
- Enter a name for your repository and optionally add a description.
- Choose whether the repository will be public or private.
- Click "Create repository".

### Step 2: Initialize the Repository
- If you want to initialize the repository with a README.md file, select that option.
- Otherwise, skip this step.

### Step 3: Clone the Repository
- Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL of your repository from the GitHub page.
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
- Run the following command:
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>

# Use an official Node.js runtime as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000 to the outside world
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]

docker build -t your-image-name:tag .
docker images
docker ps
